# 1. What's serverless?

- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore.
- They just deploy code / functions.
- Initially... Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service).
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc."
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers... it means you just don't manage / provision / see them.

## 1.1. Serverless in AWS

- AWS Lambda
- DynamoDB
- AWS Cognito
- AWS API Gateway
- Amazon S3
- AWS SNS & SQS
- AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
- Aurora Serverless
- Step Functions
- Fargate

# 2. Why AWS Lambda?

- Amazon EC2:
  - Virtual Servers in the Cloud.
  - Limited by RAM and CPU.
  - Continuously running.
  - Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers.
- Amazon Lambda:
  - Virtual **functions** - no servers to manage!
  - Limited by time - **short executions**.
  - Run **on-demand**.
  - **Scaling is automated!**

# 3. Benefits of AWS Lambda

- Easy Pricing:
  - Pay per request and compute time.
  - Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time.
- Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services.
- **Event-Driven**: functions get invoked by AWS when needed.
- Integrated with many programming languages.
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch.
- Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!).
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

# 4. Language support

- Node.js (JavaScript)
- Python
- Java (Java 8 compatible)
- C# (.NET Core)
- Golang
- C# / Powershell
- Ruby
- Custom Runtime API (community supported, example Rust)
- Lambda Container Image
  - The container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API
  - ECS / Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images

# 5. Pricing: example

- You can find overall pricing information here: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/
- Pay per **calls**:
  - First 1,000,000 requests are free.
  - $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request).
- Pay per **duration**: (in increment of 1 ms)
  - 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month for FREE.
  - == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM.
  - == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM.
  - After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds.
- It is usually **very cheap** to run AWS Lambda so it's **very popular**.
