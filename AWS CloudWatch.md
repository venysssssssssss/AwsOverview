# 1. Why Monitoring is Important

- We know how to deploy applications:
  - Safely.
  - Automatically.
  - Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
  - Leveraging the best AWS components!
- Our applications are deployed, and our users don't care how we did it...
- Our users only care that the application is working!
  - Application latency: Will it increase over time?
  - Application outages: Customer experience should not be degraded.
  - Users contacting the IT department or complaining is not a good outcome.
  - Troubleshooting and remediation.
- Internal monitoring:
  - Can we prevent issues before they happen?
  - Performance and Cost.
  - Trends (scaling patterns).
  - Learning and Improvement.

# 2. Monitoring in AWS

- AWS CloudWatch:
  - Metrics: Collect and track key metrics.
  - Logs: Collect, monitor, analyze and store log files.
  - Events: Send notifications when certain events happen in your AWS.
  - Alarms: React in real-time to metrics / events.
- AWS X-Ray:
  - Troubleshooting application performance and errors.
  - Distributed tracing of microservices.
- AWS CloudTrail:
  - Internal monitoring of API calls being made.
  - Audit changes to AWS Resources by your users.

# 3. AWS CloudWatch Metrics

- CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS.
- **Metric** is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...).
- Metrics belong to **namespaces**.
- **Dimension** is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc...).
- Up to 10 dimensions per metric.
- Metrics have **timestamps**.
- Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics.

# 4. EC2 Detailed monitoring

- EC2 instance metrics have metrics "every 5 minutes".
- With **Detailed Monitoring** (for a cost), you get data "every 1 minute".
- Use **Detailed Monitoring** if you want to scale faster for your ASG!
- The AWS Free Tier allows us to have 10 detailed monitoring metrics.
- Note: EC2 Memory usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed from inside the instance as a custom metric).

# 5. Custom Metrics

- Possibility to define and send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch.
- Example: memory (RAM) usage, disk space, number of logged in users...
- Use API call PutMetricData.
- Ability to use dimensions (attributes) to segment metrics.
  - Instance.id
  - Environment.name
- Metric resolution (StorageResolution API parameter - two possible value):
  - Standard: 1 minute (60 seconds).
  - High Resolution: 1/5/10/30 second(s) - Higher cost.
- Important: Accepts metric data points two weeks in the past and two hours in the future (make sure to configure your EC2 instance time correctly).

# 6. Logs

- **Log groups:** arbitrary name, usually representing an application.
- **Log stream:** instances within application / log files / containers.
- Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 30 days, etc..).
- CloudWatch Logs can send logs to:
  - Amazon S3 (exports).
  - Kinesis Data Streams.
  - Kinesis Data Firehose.
  - AWS Lambda.
  - ElasticSearch.

## 6.1. Sources

- SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent, CloudWatch Unified Agent.
- Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application.
- ECS: collection from containers.
- AWS Lambda: collection from function logs.
- VPC Flow Logs: VPC specific logs.
- API Gateway.
- CloudTrail based on filter.
- Route53: Log DNS queries.

# 7. Logs Metric Filter and Insights

- CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions:
  - For example, find a specific IP inside of a log.
  - Or count occurrences of "ERROR" in your logs.
- Metric filters can be used to trigger CloudWatch alarms.
- CloudWatch Logs Insights can be used to query logs and add queries to CloudWatch Dashboards.

# 8. Logs - S3 Export

- Log data can take up to 12 hours to become available for export.
- The API call is CreateExportTask.
- Not near-real time or real-time... use Logs Subscriptions instead.

# 9. Logs for EC2

- By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch.
- You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want.
- Make sure IAM permissions are correct.
- The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too.

# 10. Logs Agent & Unified Agent

- For virtual servers (EC2 instances, on-premise servers...)
- **CloudWatch Logs Agent:**
  - Old version of the agent.
  - Can only send to CloudWatch Logs.
- **CloudWatch Unified Agent:**
  - Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc...
  - Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs.
  - Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store.

# 11. Unified Agent - Metrics

- Collected directly on your Linux server / EC2 instance.
- CPU (active, guest, idle, system, user, steal).
- Disk metrics (free, used, total), Disk IO (writes, reads, bytes, iops).
- RAM (free, inactive, used, total, cached).
- Netstat (number of TCP and UDP connections, net packets, bytes).
- Processes (total, dead, bloqued, idle, running, sleep).
- Swap Space (free, used, used %).
- Reminder: out-of-the box metrics for EC2 - disk, CPU, network (high level).

# 12. Logs Metric Filter

- CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions.
  - For example, find a specific IP inside of a log.
  - Or count occurrences of "ERROR" in your logs.
  - Metric filters can be used to trigger alarms.
- Filters do not retroactively filter data. Filters only publish the metric data points for events that happen after the filter was created.

# 13. CloudWatch Alarms

- Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric.
- Various options (sampling, %, max, min, etc...).
- Alarm States:
  - OK
  - INSUFFICIENT_DATA
  - ALARM
- Period:
  - Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric.
  - **High-Resolution Custom Metrics:** 10 sec, 30 sec or multiples of 60 sec.

## 13.1. Alarm Targets

- Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an EC2 Instance.
- Trigger Auto Scaling Action.
- Send notification to SNS (from which you can do pretty much anything).

## 13.2. Composite Alarms

- CloudWatch Alarms are on a single metric.
- Composite Alarms are monitoring the states of multiple other alarms.
- AND and OR conditions.
- Helpful to reduce "alarm noise" by creating complex composite alarms.

## 13.3. EC2 Instance Recovery

- Status Check:
  - Instance status = check the EC2 VM.
  - System status = check the underlying hardware.
- Recovery: Same Private, Public, Elastic IP, metadata, placement group

## 13.4. CloudWatch Alarm: good to know

- Alarms can be created based on CloudWatch Logs Metrics Filters.
- To test alarms and notifications, set the alarm state to Alarm using CLI: `aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value ALARM --state-reason "testing purposes"`

# 14. CloudWatch Events (Will be replaced with EventBridge)

- Event Pattern: Intercept events from AWS services (Sources):
  - Example sources: EC2 Instance Start, CodeBuild Failure, S3, Trusted Advisor.
  - Can intercept any API call with CloudTrail integration.
- Schedule or Cron (example: create an event every 4 hours).
- A JSON payload is created from the event and passed to a target...
  - Compute: Lambda, Batch, ECS task.
  - Integration: SQS, SNS, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose.
  - Orchestration: Step Functions, CodePipeline, CodeBuild.
  - Maintenance: SSM, EC2 Actions.

# 15. Amazon EventBridge

- Is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services.
- Delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources such as Zendesk or Shopify to targets like AWS Lambda and other SaaS applications.
- You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real-time to your data sources with event publisher and consumer completely decoupled.
- EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events.
- **Default event bus**: generated by AWS services (CloudWatch Events).
- **Partner event bus**: receive events from SaaS service or applications (Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0...).
- Custom Event buses: for your own applications.
- Schema Registry: model event schema.
- Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts.
- You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period).
- Ability to replay archived events.
- Rules: how to process the events (like CloudWatch Events).
- EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities.

## 15.1. Schema Registry

- EventBridge can analyze the events in your bus and infer the schema.
- The Schema Registry allows you to generate code for your application, that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus.
- Schema can be versioned.

## 15.2. Resource-based Policy

- Manage permissions for a specific Event Bus.
- Example: allow/deny events from another AWS account or AWS region.
- Use case: aggregate all events from your AWS Organization in a single AWS account or AWS region.

# 16. Amazon EventBridge vs CloudWatch Events

- Amazon EventBridge builds upon and extends CloudWatch Events.
- It uses the same service API and endpoint, and the same underlying service infrastructure.
- EventBridge allows extension to add event buses for your custom applications and your third-party SaaS apps.
- Event Bridge has the Schema Registry capability.
- EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities.
- Over time, the CloudWatch Events name will be replaced with EventBridge.
