# 1. Introduction

- **Is a web service that records activity made on your account and delivers log files to your Amazon S3 bucket. AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.**
- **Can record the history of events/API calls made within you AWS account, which will help determine who or what deleted the resource. You should investigate it first.**
- Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account.
- CloudTrail is enabled by default!
- Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
  - Console.
  - SDK.
  - CLI.
  - AWS Services.
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3.
- A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
- If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!

# 2. Events

- Management Events:
  - Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account.
  - Examples:
    - Configuring security (IAM AttachRolePolicy).
    - Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet).
    - Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail).
- By default, trails are configured to log management events.
- Can separate Read Events (that don’t modify resources) from Write Events (that may modify resources).
- Data Events:
  - By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations).
  - Amazon S3 object-level activity (ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject): can separate Read and Write Events.
  - AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API).

# 3. Insights

- **AWS CloudTrail Insights helps AWS users identify and respond to unusual activity associated with write API calls by continuously analyzing CloudTrail management events.**
- Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
  - Inaccurate resource provisioning.
  - Hitting service limits.
  - Bursts of AWS IAM actions.
  - Gaps in periodic maintenance activity.
- CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline.
- And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns:
  - Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console.
  - Event is sent to Amazon S3.
  - An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs).

# 4. Events Retention

- Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail.
- To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena.

# 5. CloudTrail vs CloudWatch vs X-Ray

- CloudTrail:
  - Audit API calls made by users / services / AWS console.
  - Useful to detect unauthorized calls or root cause of changes.
- CloudWatch:
  - CloudWatch Metrics over time for monitoring.
  - CloudWatch Logs for storing application log.
  - CloudWatch Alarms to send notifications in case of unexpected metrics.
- X-Ray:
  - Automated Trace Analysis & Central Service Map Visualization.
  - Latency, Errors and Fault analysis.
  - Request tracking across distributed systems.
